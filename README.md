This repository demonstrates my proficiency in Python by analysing the "Amazon Sales Data" dataset. The dataset consists of 12 CSV files, each representing a month's worth of Amazon sales, providing detailed insights into ordering patterns, product details, quantities, prices, order dates, and purchase addresses.

Project Overview

The project showcases my skills in:

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from errors and inconsistencies.
Data Wrangling: Transforming and mapping raw data into a more usable format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using pandas for an in-depth analysis to uncover patterns and insights.
Data Modeling: Visualizing data with Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify trends and relationships.

Dataset Columns

Order ID: Unique identification number for each order.
Product: Description of the product being ordered.
Quantity Ordered: The amount of the product ordered in a particular transaction.
Price Each: The price of each product unit.
Order Date: The date and time when the order was placed.
Purchase Address: The address where the order was delivered.

Key Benefits

Analyzing this dataset provides a deep understanding of Amazon sales trends over 12 months. It is a valuable resource for:
Market research
Sales forecasting
Product analysis
Customer behavior analysis
This project highlights how researchers, data scientists, and business professionals can use Python to uncover patterns, identify popular products, understand pricing strategies, and derive actionable insights for optimizing sales and business strategies.
